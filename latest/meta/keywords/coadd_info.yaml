    title: Start Time of the First Exposure
    description: >
      The Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) start time of
      the first exposure ordered in time used to create the
      co-added product. The time is serialized on disk as an
      International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
      8601-compliant ISOT string. If opened in Python with the
      asdf-astropy package installed, it may be read as an
      astropy.time.Time object with all of the associated methods
      and transforms available. See the documentation for
      astropy.time.Time objects for more information.

    description: >
      The Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) end time of
      the last exposure ordered in time used to create the

      The Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) mean start

    title: Maximum Exposure Time (s)
    description: >
      Maximum exposure time of all pixels in the
      co-added product in units of seconds. The exposure times of
      each input pixel are drizzled onto the output frame, and
      then the maximum is computed from all output pixels with
      exposure time > 0 seconds.

    title: Exposure Time (s)
    description: >
      A representative exposure time for the co-added
      product in units of seconds. For Roman SOC products, the
      exposure times of each input pixel are drizzled on the
      output frame, and then the mean exposure time is computed
      from all output pixels with exposure time > 0 seconds.
