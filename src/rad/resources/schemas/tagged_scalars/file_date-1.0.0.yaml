# This is to facilitate the auto generation of a datamodel from this schema
#   the reference to an external schema that describes a non-datamodel or
#   primitive type. In reality, this schema is meant to define a wrapper
#   around that type, which is rather difficult to detect automatically.
#   This key is a compromise to allow the auto-generator to easily figure
#   out that it needs to do this.
